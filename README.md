# program-evaluation-with-matching

## Program Evaluation without Randomization (with Matching): Project Overview

Walk through of a hypothetical program evaluation, where we evaluate training program's effect on performance, where participation was not randomized and matching is used to control for differences between participants and non-participants.

- Utilized a kaggle sample dataset for attrition analysis from ibm
- Simulated participation in the program
- Explored differences between participant group and non-participant population
- Attempted and evaluated different types of matching
- Got matches using our best matching specs
- Esimated marginal effect of particpation on performance
- Brief explanation on limitations of matching
